This is a fork of The Engine from [3DMMForever](https://github.com/foone/3DMMForever), packaged for Zig. Unnecessary
files have been deleted, and the build system has been replaced with
`build.zig`. The `upstream` branch of this repository contains a mirror of the
original source tree. When the upstream repository is updated, the changes are
merged from `upstream` into this `main` branch.
